Overview
========

Kestrel threat hunting language provides an abstraction for threat hunters to
focus on *what to hunt* instead of *how to hunt*. The abstraction makes it
possible to codify resuable hunting knowledge in a composable and sharable
manner. And Kestrel runtime figures out *how to hunt* for hunters to make cyber
threat hunting less tedious and more efficient.

   :alt: Kestrel overview.

- **Kestrel language**: a threat hunting language for a human to express *what to
  hunt*.

  - expressing the knowledge of *what* in patterns, analytics, and hunt flows.
  - composing reusable hunting flows from individual hunting steps.
  - reasoning with human-friendly entity-based data representation abstraction.
  - thinking across heterogeneous data and threat intelligence sources.
  - applying existing public and proprietary detection logic as analytics.
  - reusing and sharing individual hunting steps and entire hunt books.

- **Kestrel runtime**: a machine interpreter that deals with *how to hunt*.

  - compiling the *what* against specific hunting platform instructions.
  - executing the compiled code locally and remotely.
  - assembling raw logs and records into entities for entity-based reasoning.
  - caching intermediate data and related records for fast response.
  - prefetching related logs and records for link construction between entities.
  - defining extensible interfaces for data sources and analytics execution.

Installation
============

Kestrel requires Python 3 to run. Check `Python installation guide`_ if you
do not have Python. It is preferred to install Kestrel runtime using `pip`_,
and it is preferred to install Kestrel runtime in a `Python virtual
environment`_.

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
    $ pip install kestrel-jupyter
    $ python -m kestrel_jupyter_kernel.setup
    $ jupyter notebook

Hello World Hunt
================

1. Copy the following 3-step hunt flow into your favorite text editor:

.. code-block:: elixir

    # create four process entities in Kestrel and store them in the variable `proclist`
    proclist = NEW process [ {"name": "cmd.exe", "pid": "123"}
                           , {"name": "explorer.exe", "pid": "99"}
                           , {"name": "firefox.exe", "pid": "201"}
                           , {"name": "chrome.exe", "pid": "205"}
                           ]

    # match a pattern of browser processes, and put the matched entities in variable `browsers`
    browsers = GET process FROM proclist WHERE [process:name IN ('firefox.exe', 'chrome.exe')]

    # display the information (attributes name, pid) of the entities in variable `browsers`
    DISP browsers ATTR name, pid

2. Save to a file ``helloworld.hf``.

3. Execute the hunt flow in a terminal (in Python venv if virtual environment is used):

.. code-block:: console

    $ kestrel helloworld.hf

Now you captured browser processes in a Kestrel variable ``browsers`` from all processes created:

::
    
           name pid
     chrome.exe 205
    firefox.exe 201

    [SUMMARY] block executed in 1 seconds
    VARIABLE    TYPE  #(ENTITIES)  #(RECORDS)  process*
    proclist process            4           4         0
    browsers process            2           2         0
    *Number of related records cached.

Talks And Demos
===============

Kestrel was debuted at RSA Conference 2021: `The Game of Cyber Threat Hunting:
The Return of the Fun`_ with the goal of an `efficient cyberthreat hunting
symbiosis`_, its key design concepts `entity-based reasoning`_ and `composable
hunt flow`_, and a `small-enterprise APT hunting demo`_ with TTP pattern
matching, cross-host provenance tracking, TI-enrichment, machine learning
analytics, and more.

Kestrel was further introduced to the threat hunting community at `SANS Threat
Hunting Summit 2021`_ in session `Compose Your Hunts With Reusable Knowledge
and Share Your Huntbook With the Community`_ to facilitate huntbook
composition, sharing, and reuse---from simple single hunt step demos (TTP
pattern matching, provenance tracking, and data visualization analytics) to
complex comprehensive hunt flow composition.

Kestrel, together with `STIX-shifter`_, `Elastic`_, and `SysFlow`_ constitute
the `open hunting stack`_ demoed at Black Hat Europe 2021: `An Open Stack for
Threat Hunting in Hybrid Cloud With Connected Observability`_. A supply chain
attack variant across a hybrid cloud (two clouds and on-premises machines) was
hunted in the arsenal session.

Kestrel was demoed at `Infosec Jupyterthon 2021`_ in session: `Reason Cyber
Campaigns With Kestrel`_. The live hunting demo explained the basics of Kestrel
throughout the discovery of the hybrid cloud APT campaign developed for our
Black Hat Europe 2021 session.
